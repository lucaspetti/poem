    Fly away, fly away, breath; <br>I am slain by a fair cruel maid. <br>\
    My shroud of white, stuck all with yew, <br>O, prepare it! <br>\
    My part of death, no one so true <br>Did share it. <br><br>\
    Not a flower, not a flower sweet, <br>On my black coffin let there be strown. <br>\
    Not a friend, not a friend greet <br>My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown. <br>\
    A thousand thousand sighs to save, <br>Lay me, O, where <br>\
    Sad true lover never find my grave, <br>To weep there!"
