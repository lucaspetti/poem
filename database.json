  Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,<br />\
  On a black throne reigns upright,<br />\
  I have reached these lands but newly<br />\
  From an ultimate dim Thule<br />\
  From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,<br />\
  Out of SPACE -- out of TIME.<br /><br />\

  Bottomless vales and boundless floods,<br />\
  And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,<br />\
  With forms that no man can discover<br />\
  For the dews that drip all over;<br />\
  Mountains toppling evermore<br />\
  Into seas without a shore;<br />\
  Seas that restlessly aspire,<br />\
  Surging, unto skies of fire;<br />\
  Lakes that endlessly outspread<br />\
  Their lone waters -- lone and dead, --<br />\
  Their still waters -- still and chilly<br />\
  With the snows of the lolling lily.<br /><br />\
\
  By the lakes that thus outspread<br />\
  Their lone waters, lone and dead, --<br />\
  Their sad waters, sad and chilly<br />\
  With the snows of the lolling lily, --<br />\
  By the mountains -- near the river<br />\
  Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever, --<br />\
  By the grey woods, -- by the swamp<br />\
  Where the toad and the newt encamp, --<br />\
  By the dismal tarns and pools<br />\
  Where dwell the Ghouls, --<br />\
  By each spot the most unholy --<br />\
  In each nook most melancholy, --<br />\
  There the traveller meets aghast<br />\
  Sheeted Memories of the Past --<br />\
  Shrouded forms that start and sigh<br />\
  As they pass the wanderer by --<br />\
  White-robed forms of friends long given,<br />\
  In agony, to the Earth -- and Heaven.<br /><br />\
  \
  For the heart whose woes are legion<br />\
  \"Tis a peaceful, soothing region --<br />\
  For the spirit that walks in shadow<br />\
  \"Tis -- oh \"tis an Eldorado!<br />\
  But the traveller, travelling through it,<br />\
  May not -- dare not openly view it;<br />\
  Never its mysteries are exposed<br />\
  To the weak human eye unclosed;<br />\
  So wills its King, who hath forbid<br />\
  The uplifting of the fringed lid;<br />\
  And thus the sad Soul that here passes<br />\
  Beholds it but through darkened glasses.<br /><br />\
  \
  By a route obscure and lonely,<br />\
  Haunted by ill angels only, <br />\
  Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,<br />\
  On a black throne reigns upright,<br />\
  I have wandered home but newly<br />\
  From this ultimate dim Thule.<br />"

To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br><br>\
Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>\
And having perhaps the better claim,<br>\
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>\
Though as for that the passing there<br>\
Had worn them really about the same,<br><br>\
And both that morning equally lay<br>\
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>\
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>\
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>\
I doubted if I should ever come back.<br><br>\
I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>\
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>\
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br>\
I took the one less traveled by,<br>\
And that has made all the difference."

    Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,<br>\
   Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;<br>\
Conspiring with him how to load and bless<br>\
   With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;<br>\
To bend with apples the moss\"d cottage-trees,<br>\
   And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;<br>\
      To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells<br>\
   With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,<br>\
And still more, later flowers for the bees,<br>\
Until they think warm days will never cease,<br>\
      For summer has o\"er-brimm\"d their clammy cells.<br><br>\
Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?<br>\
   Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find<br>\
Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,<br>\
   Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;<br>\
Or on a half-reap\"d furrow sound asleep,<br>\
   Drows\"d with the fume of poppies, while thy hook<br>\
      Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers:<br>\
And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep<br>\
   Steady thy laden head across a brook;<br>\
   Or by a cyder-press, with patient look,<br>\
      Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.<br><br>\
Where are the songs of spring? Ay, Where are they?<br>\
   Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,—<br>\
While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,<br>\
   And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;<br>\
Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn<br>\
   Among the river sallows, borne aloft<br>\
      Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;<br>\
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;<br>\
   Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft<br>\
   The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;<br>\
      And gathering swallows twitter in the skies."

With usura hath no man a house of good stone<br>\

with usura<br>\
hath no man a painted paradise on his church wall<br>\
harpes et luz<br>\

seeth no man Gonzaga his heirs and his concubines<br>\
no picture is made to endure nor to live with<br>\
but it is made to sell and sell quickly<br>\
with usura, sin against nature,<br>\
is thy bread ever more of stale rags<br>\
is thy bread dry as paper,<br>\
with no mountain wheat, no strong flour<br>\
with usura the line grows thick<br>\
with usura is no clear demarcation<br>\

Stonecutter is kept from his tone<br>\
weaver is kept from his loom<br><br>\
WITH USURA<br>\
wool comes not to market<br>\
sheep bringeth no gain with usura<br>\
Usura is a murrain, usura<br>\
blunteth the needle in the maid\"s hand<br>\

came not by usura<br>\
Duccio came not by usura<br>\

Came no church of cut stone signed: Adamo me fecit.<br>\
Not by usura St. Trophime<br>\
Not by usura Saint Hilaire,<br>\
Usura rusteth the chisel<br>\
It rusteth the craft and the craftsman<br>\
It gnaweth the thread in the loom<br>\
None learneth to weave gold in her pattern;<br>\
Azure hath a canker by usura; cramoisi is unbroidered<br>\
Emerald findeth no Memling<br>\
Usura slayeth the child in the womb<br>\
It stayeth the young man\"s courting<br>\
It hath brought palsey to bed, lyeth<br>\
between the young bride and her bridegroom<br><br>\
CONTRA NATURAM<br>\
They have brought whores for Eleusis<br>\
Corpses are set to banquet<br>\
at behest of usura."
