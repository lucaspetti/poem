\    And in sad cypress let me be laid. <br>\ 
Fly away, fly away, breath; <br>\
\    I am slain by a fair cruel maid. <br>\
My shroud of white, stuck all with yew, <br>\
\             O, prepare it! <br>\
My part of death, no one so true <br>\
\         Did share it. <br>\
<br>\
Not a flower, not a flower sweet, <br>\
\    On my black coffin let there be strown. <br>\
Not a friend, not a friend greet <br>\
\    My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown. <br>\
A thousand thousand sighs to save, <br>\
\             Lay me, O, where <br>\
Sad true lover never find my grave, <br>\
\             To weep there!'*/

my heart)i am never without it(anywhere<br>\
i go you go,my dear;and whatever is done<br>\
by only me is your doing,my darling)<br>\
\                                                      i fear<br>\
no fate(for you are my fate,my sweet)i want<br>\
no world(for beautiful you are my world,my true)<br>\
and itâ€™s you are whatever a moon has always meant<br>\
and whatever a sun will always sing is you<br>\
<br>\
here is the deepest secret nobody knows<br>\
(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud<br>\
and the sky of the sky of a tree called life;which grows<br>\
higher than soul can hope or mind can hide)<br>\
and this is the wonder that\'s keeping the stars apart<br>\
<br>\
i carry your heart\(i carry it in my heart)<br>'
