This is a short web application that sorts poems in their original language.

You can select the language you want and then click on the button "sort" to sort a poem and the picture of the author.

I added six languages to start: English, French, Spanish, German, Italian and Portuguese.
I chose these because they are the ones I can read (or at least try to).
