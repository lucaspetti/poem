# poem
This is a short web application that sorts poems in their original language.

To access the website <a href="https://lucaspetti.github.io/poem/" target="_blank">click here</a>.

I added six languages to start: English, French, Spanish, German, Italian and Portuguese.
I chose these because they are the ones I can read (or at least try to).

I intend to add a search input in the future where the user can search for any keyword, authors or poem titles.
