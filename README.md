# poem

This is a simple web application that sorts poems in their original language.

You can select the language you want and then click on the button "sort" to sort a poem and the picture of the author. The poems are stored in a JSON file.

I added six languages to start: English, French, Spanish, German, Italian and Portuguese.
I chose these because they are the ones I can read (or at least try to).

Application created using Javascript and refactored in React.
